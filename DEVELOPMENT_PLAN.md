- **Phase 3-4**: May require additional services (Redis, CDN)
- **Phase 5-6**: Enterprise features may need upgraded plans

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve development plan
2. Set up project management (GitHub Projects/Linear)
3. Create detailed technical specifications for Phase 1
4. Begin UI/UX redesign with mockups
5. Set up staging environment on Railway
